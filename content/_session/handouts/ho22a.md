## I. The Background We Need to Know to Understand the Book of Psalms

There are three areas of background information that are very helpful for understanding the book of Psalms:

   - A. The main outlines of the history of Israel.

   - B. The life of David, in particular.

   - C. The three covenants: covenant with Abraham, the Sinai covenant, and the covenant with David.

This section will summarize what the book of psalms assumes the reader knows from those three areas. It will also list some of the psalms that refer to these events and covenants.

### A. The Main Outlines of the History of Israel

We have seen all of these before in H/O #03, H/O #O4, and H/O #07. Here we are repeating the ones which are particularly important for reading the Psalms, because the Psalms refer to them.

* Moses & the exodus from Egypt. Ps 105:38.

* Israel received the Law and entered into a covenant with God at Mt Sinai (Exod 24). Ps 1:2; Ps 10:5; Ps 19:7; Ps 50:16; Ps 78:5,10,56; Ps 89:30; Ps 147:119,20.

* Israel spied out the land, but did not trust God, and was afraid to enter the land (Num 13, 14). Ps 106:24-27.

* So God decreed that Israel would wander in the wilderness for 40 years, until the generation which did not believe him all died off (Num 14; Num 26:6-65; Deut 1 & 2; Josh 5:4-7).

* That same generation committed idolatry with the Baal of Peor (Num 25). Ps 106:28-31.

* When the 40 years was done, Joshua led them into the land, as God drove out the nations from before Israel (the book of Joshua). Ps 44:1-8; 105:44.

* But after Joshua died, Israel failed to continue to drive out the nations. Israel began to be influenced by their pagan customs (in the time of the Judges). Ps 106:34-36.

* After that, when Israel had kings, some of Israel's kings were good. But several of Israel's kings were evil; some even worshipped the gods of Canaan. Israel was unfaithful to the Lord, and broke the covenant. Ps 106:37-39.

* As a result, God brought severe judgment upon Israel. First the northern kingdom fell (in 722 BC). Then Judah fell to the Babylonians; Jerusalem & the temple were destroyed in 586 BC, and Judah went into exile. Ps 74; Ps 79; Ps 106:40-42.

* But after 70 years, God brought the Jews back to Judah and Jerusalem. Ps 107; Ps 126; Ps 137; Ps 147.

### B. The Main Events in David's Life

These are the events in David's life which various psalms refer to:

* David is chosen and anointed by God to be king. Ps 78:71; Ps 89:20.

* Saul persecutes David, and tries to kill him. See the superscriptions to Ps 52, 54, 57, & 59.

* David becomes king; he brings the ark of the covenant into Jerusalem. Ps 24; Ps 132:8.

* God promises David that a son of his will reign on his throne forever (= the Davidic covenant). Ps 89:3-4, 19-29, 34-37; Ps 132.

* David's sin with Bathsheba; David's confession. Ps 51; Ps 32.

* The rebellion of David's son Absalom. Ps 3 (and perhaps Ps 42 & 43).

### C. The Three Covenants: Abraham, Sinai, and David

The psalms assume the reader is generally familiar with these three covenants. We have already mentioned them in H/O #09. We list them here simply for review.

* God promised Abraham that He would bless him, make him into a great nation, and would bless all nations of the earth through Abraham and his seed.

   ```
   Ps 105:8-9,42; Ps 106:44-46; probably also Ps 47:9, Ps 74:20, and Ps 87.
   ```

* Israel received the Law and entered into a covenant with God at Mt Sinai (Exod 24).

   ```
   Ps 1:2; Ps 10:5; Ps 19:7; Ps 50:16; Ps 78:5,10,56; Ps 89:30; Ps 147:119,20.
   ```

* God promised David that a son of his will reign on his throne forever (= the Davidic covenant).

   ```
   Ps 89:3-4, 19-29, 34-37; Ps 132.
   ```

You will find that, as you read the Psalms, many of them will make more sense to you if you are familiar with events and covenants listed above.
