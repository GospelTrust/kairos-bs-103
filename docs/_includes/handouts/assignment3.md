## For your own reflection:

It is true that Israel / Judah was unfaithful to God in a way that Babylon was not. But in general, would it be fair to say that Babylon was a worse nation than Judah? (Hint: Hab 1:13)

Q: If God wishes to, can he judge a bad nation by using one that is even worse?

Q: But will God let the worse nation go without ever being punished?
