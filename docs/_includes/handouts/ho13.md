H/O #13 – The Importance of the Exile

# A. The Exile – What it is, and Why it is Very Important.

1. Where Does the Exile Fall in Israel’s History?
Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt at 1446 B# C. Israel came to Mt Sinai later that same year. At Mt Sinai they had a dramatic encounter with God. They also entered into the Sinai covenant with God, and received the Law (the Law both guides Israel’s life and is also the requirements of the Sinai covenant). After Moses died, Israel crossed the Jordan river and entered the promised land under the leadership of Joshua. This occurred at about 1400 BC.

David became the king of Israel approximately 400 years after the time of Joshua. Thus David ruled as king over Israel around the year 1000 B# C. He was followed by Solomon. When Solomon died (931 BC), the kingdom of Israel split into two kingdoms. The northern kingdom had 10 tribes and was called “Israel.” The southern kingdom had 2 tribes (Judah
& Benjamin), and was called “Judah.”

The kings who were descended from David and then Solomon ruled Judah, the southern kingdom, from its capital city, Jerusalem. These kings ruled Judah for over of 400 years. This line of kings ruling Judah came to an end when Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians (led by king Nebuchadnezzar), in 587/586 B# C. That is when the exile begins.

2. What is the Exile?
When Jerusalem fell, the Babylonians destroyed the Temple and much of Jerusalem. They took thousands of Jews to Babylon to be workers, servants, and slaves (not all of them were slaves). The Jews remained in Babylon for 70 years, until Babylon itself was conquered by the Persians (see Daniel 5). Shortly after that happened, the Persian king Cyrus decreed that the Jews could go home = they could return to Jerusalem (see 2 Chron 36 and Ezra 1). The 70 years they spent in Babylon, away from the promised land, are called “the exile.”
