# I. COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course introduces the student to the serious study of the Old Testament. It will survey all of the OT books as well as outlining the overall history of the Old Testament. It will set forth the larger picture of the Old Testament as a basis for developing an integrated understanding of it. The course will give students the skills and the basic information necessary to read the Old Testament productively on their own.

# II. COURSE OBJECTIVES

A student who has successfully completed this course:

1. Will know the main events and the chronological flow of the Old Testament.

2. Will know and be able to use a sound interpretive method for reading the Old Testament. This involves learning to recognize and appreciate:

   • the importance of reading individual passages in light of their immediate context as well as that of the book and set of books in which they occur;

   • where books fit in the overall history and flow of the Old Testament, and how that knowledge helps us to understand each book;

   • the various types of literature ("genre") in the OT;

   • the specific cultural & religious settings into which the OT was written, which can help clarify the difference between a pagan understanding of “the gods,” versus a biblical understanding of the one true God.

3. Will understand and be able to explain the concept of covenant, and will recognize its importance for determining what aspects of the Old Testament apply to Christians.

4. Will become familiar with at least one viable theological framework for understanding the Old Testament, with a view toward understanding what applies to Christians today, what doesn't, and why.

5. Will have a greater recognition and appreciation for how the Old Testament sets the stage for reading and understanding the New Testament.
